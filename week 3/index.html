		<h2>Places I've Lived</h2>
		This map shows the cities that I have lived in throughout my life. Beginning with San Diego California where I
		was born, then to Ventura where I grew up and lived most of my life, then to Fort Lee Virginia where I spent
		about a year in military training before being stationed in Camp Lejeune NC for about 4 years. The last entry is
		in Los Angeles where I am currently living.
