This site uses a heatmap to show which neighborhoods have the most property value appreciation. 
There is also other other info that can be either layered or mapped instead such as crime, home prices, schools, etc.

I chose this particular site (and location) because I am a new homeowner and like to keep track of all these things as I plan for the future.

The site works pretty similarly to google maps and the interface is pretty straightforward. 
Some features and locations are only available to premium subscribers unfortunately.

The site uses Mapbox and OpenStreetMap.

If I could change something it would be to have the data show up for wherever you focus the map as you move around rather than reselecting areas.
