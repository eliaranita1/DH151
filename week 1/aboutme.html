<p style= "font-size: larger;"> My name is Eli Aranita, and I am an electrical engineering major at UCLA.
     I am from Ventura CA and have lived in southern California <i>most</i> of my life. Before transferring to UCLA,
     I earned associates degrees in engineering and mathematics from Santa Barbara City College. Prior to that,
     I served 5 years active duty in the Marine Corps and spent most of that time stationed in North Carolina
     with Marine Special Operations Command (MARSOC) where my primary job was to maintain electronic missile
     systems and other weapons related electronics. Before the Marines, I worked as a union apprentice electrician
     where I got to work on large commercial and industrial sites such as hospitals and the new construction at CSUCI.
